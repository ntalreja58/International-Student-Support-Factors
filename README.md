## Research Question
The study aimed to investigate how various factors and justifications influence U.S. citizens' support for the policy of allowing international students to study and work in the United States. These factors included economic contributions, impact on U.S. global competitiveness, and moral considerations.

## Introduction
We focussed on the multifaceted dynamics surrounding support for international students among U.S. citizens. We also provided a comprehensive understanding of the attitudes and beliefs underpinning this support.

## Experimental Design
We conducted a survey with three groups:
Control group : no justifications provided 
Economic group : A group exposed to economic justifications 
Moral group : A group exposed to moral justifications

## Hypothesis
We expected to find that Americans will prefer the economic justification for setting aside a percentage of the student body for international students over the moral justification.
