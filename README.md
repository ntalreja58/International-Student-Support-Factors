## Research Question
The study aimed to investigate how various factors and justifications influence U.S. citizens' support for the policy of allowing international students to study and work in the United States. These factors included economic contributions, impact on U.S. global competitiveness, and moral considerations.

## Introduction
We focussed on the multifaceted dynamics surrounding support for international students among U.S. citizens. We also provided a comprehensive understanding of the attitudes and beliefs underpinning this support.

## Experimental Design
We conducted a survey with three groups:

Control group : no justifications provided `control group article.png`

Economic group : A group exposed to economic justifications `economic article.png`

Moral group : A group exposed to moral justifications `moral article.png`

## Hypothesis
We expected to find that Americans will prefer the economic justification for setting aside a percentage of the student body for international students over the moral justification.

## Findings
The analysis explored how opinions on the university's 15% admission reservation policy varied across different demographic factors like gender and education level, across the three groups (Control, Economic, and Moral). 

1. Comparison of responses across control, economic, and moral groups:
   - For the question "Are you in favor or opposition to the university's new policy?", the responses were mostly "Neutral" or "Somewhat in opposition" across all three groups.
   - For the question "Did the article shape your opinion?", most respondents selected "Neither convincing nor unconvincing" or "Somewhat convincing" across the groups.
   - For the question "How convincing did you find the article?", the most common response was "15% is about the correct amount" across all three groups.
   - For the question "Opinion on the reservation percentage?", the majority selected "15% is too high" or "15% is about the correct amount" in all groups.

2. Gender analysis:
   - For the question on favoring/opposing the policy, more males were in opposition compared to females.
   - For the question on whether the article shaped opinions, more males found it unconvincing compared to females.
   - For the question on how convincing the article was, more males found the 15% reservation too high compared to females.
   - For the opinion on the reservation percentage, more males found 15% too high compared to females.

3. Education level analysis:
   - For most questions, those with higher education levels (Bachelor's or Graduate degree) were more likely to be in opposition to the policy or find the 15% reservation too high compared to those with lower education levels.

4. ANOVA tests:
   - There were no significant differences in age, gender, or ethnicity across the control, economic, and moral groups.
   - Responses to the question "Are you in favor or opposition to the policy?" differed significantly across the possible answer options.

There were some notable differences, with males and those with higher education levels tending to be more opposed to the policy or finding the 15% reservation too high. However, the provided articles did not seem to significantly sway opinions across the different groups.
