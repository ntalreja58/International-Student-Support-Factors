DACSS 602 (Fall 2023)

### **1. Project Overview**

The objective of this group project was to design, implement, and analyze a survey experiment using Qualtrics. This project aimed to test a hypothesis related to the group's common research topic. The process involved developing a hypothesis, designing an appropriate experimental framework, programming the survey, collecting data via mTurk, and analyzing the results.

### **2. Process**

1. **Development of Hypotheses and Experiment Design:**
   Each group developed a research hypothesis and decided on an experimental design (within-subject or between-subject) to test their hypothesis. This involved creating a detailed proposal using templates provided by the instructor. Proposals were discussed in a group meeting with the instructor and presented in class for feedback.

2. **Familiarization with Qualtrics:**
   Groups were provided with two sets of tutorials developed by DACSS students to become proficient in programming their experiments using Qualtrics.

3. **Programming the Survey:**
   Each group programmed their survey experiment in Qualtrics, carefully designing the survey flow and questions to ensure they aligned with the experimental design and hypothesis.

4. **Data Collection:**
   The instructor combined the individual surveys into one or two comprehensive surveys and distributed them via mTurk to collect data from a suitable sample. This approach ensured a diverse and representative data set.

5. **Data Analysis:**
   Groups analyzed the collected data over a two-week period using appropriate statistical methods. This analysis aimed to test the hypothesis and uncover any significant findings related to the research topic.

6. **Poster Preparation:**
   After analyzing the data, each group prepared a comprehensive poster summarizing their methodology, findings, and conclusions. This poster was designed to effectively communicate the research process and results.

7. **Presentation:**
   In the final week of the semester, groups presented their posters in class. This presentation provided an opportunity to share findings with peers and receive feedback on the research.

### **3. Final Results**

The final results included insights into the research hypothesis and the effectiveness of the experimental design. The analysis provided data-driven conclusions that were summarized in the poster presentation. This project also enhanced students' skills in experimental design, survey programming, data analysis, and presentation.
