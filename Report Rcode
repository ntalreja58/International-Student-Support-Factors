# focus on g1_DO (Display Order: g#_DO) to find 
# which treatment R received.
# Group 1's treatments are placed in the last part of the string, 
# g1q3, g1q4, g1q5, g1q6
# what we'd like to do is to create a new variable 
# that has four levels
# for the four treatments
# to use the str_detect() function, let's use stringr() package
